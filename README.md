Musical hacks, in and around s'Gravenhage, 2006,

`take1.mp3` <- `take1.pl` (a Perl5 script - squencing a MIDI tune) where a walking bassline is a SchÃ¶nberg `twelve-tone` going through the 4 interval perserving transformations, `P I R RI`, chords are alternated from halving the basslines. This is note 'total serialism', but only tonal 4/4, right now. This was my first attempt at computer-aided composition, the actual series was selected manually on a bass guitar. My school mate Andrzej Kwiecinski - used the same serial-line by chance, but I wrote this before we two have met.



TODO: 

  *add source code for the FM-spiral binural beats
  *put mp3's also in soundcloud


Musically:
 * 'take1' needs another 'time-signature' episode
